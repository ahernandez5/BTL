# Beyond the Light Project
Award Winning X11/OpenGL C++ Semester 2D-Game project

Beyond the Light is a ghost hunting game. We created a character; her name is Mortana, a ghost hunter.
She walks around eliminating ghosts as they appear and re-paper randomly from all different directions
to frighten the character. Mortana has magical powers. She can electrocute ghosts and
cast spells. The spells eliminate the largest number of ghosts. If Mortana fails to detect and eliminate any of the ghosts in time and it touches her, then its GAME OVER!
